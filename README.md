If you're having any trouble after reading through this `README`, feel free ask for help in the Starship Support text channels. Please keep in mind that we do not condone piracy.

# Quick Start

Starship does not include any copyrighted assets.  You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
The supported ROMs are US 1.0 and US 1.1 Rev A versions. You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the SHA-1 File Checksum Online at https://www.romhacking.net/hash/. 

* The SHA-1 hash for a US 1.0 ROM is D8B1088520F7C5F81433292A9258C1184AFA1457.
* The SHA-1 hash for a US 1.1 ROM is 09F0D105F476B00EFA5303A3EBC42E60A7753B7A.

Starship also supports voice language replacement use from both EU (Lylat) and JP (Japanese) when used in conjunction with an US ROM.

Note: JP and EU versions of the game are not supported for the base asset O2R creation, a US ROM must be used for it, and you can only use one voice language replacement at a time (Either EU or JP).

### 2. Verify your ROM is in .z64 format
Your ROM needs to be in .z64 format. If it's in .n64 format, use the following to convert it to a .z64: https://hack64.net/tools/swapper.php

### 2. Download Starship from [Releases](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Starship/releases)

### 3. Generating the OTR from the ROM and Play!
#### Windows
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Run starship.exe and select your US 1.0 or US 1.1 ROM.

#### Linux
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Execute starship.appimage. You may have to chmod +x the appimage via terminal.

#### MacOS
* Extract every file from the zip into a folder of your choosing.
* Run starship and select your US 1.0 or US 1.1 ROM.

#### Nintendo Switch
* Run one of the PC releases to generate an `sf64.o2r` file. After launching the game on PC, you will be able to find these files in the same directory as `starship.exe` or `starship.appimage`.
* Copy the files to your sd card

# Configuration

### Default keyboard configuration
| N64 | A | B | Z | Start | Analog stick | C buttons | D-Pad |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Keyboard | X | C | Z | Space | WASD | Arrow keys | TFGH |

### Other shortcuts
| Keys | Action |
| - | - |
| F1 | Toggle menubar |
| F4 | Reset |
| F11 | Fullscreen |
| Tab | Toggle Alternate assets |

### Graphics Backends
Currently, there are three rendering APIs supported: DirectX11 (Windows), OpenGL (all platforms), and Metal (macOS). You can change which API to use in the `Settings` menu of the menubar, which requires a restart.  If you're having an issue with crashing, you can change the API in the `starship.cfg.json` file by finding the line `"Backend":{`... and changing the `id` value to `3` and set the `Name` to `OpenGL`. `DirectX 11` with id `2` is the default on Windows. `Metal` with id `4` is the default on macOS.

# Custom Assets
Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin (Note that SF64 is not supported at this time)**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)

# Development
### Building
